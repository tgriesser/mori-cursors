# mori-cursors

### Note: 

This repository is not actively maintained and serves as a proof of concept for using mori with custom extended protocols. Recommended for use as a reference, but not for anything serious.

---

Provides basic [cursor](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Cursors) 
functionality for mori data structures, using a mori build which supports 
extending vanilla javascript objects with clojurescript protocols.
